    "Mage|To keep Kite simple, and to keep this section from being too bloated with redundant or otherwise similar classes; the \"Mage\" class includes all schools of magic. Meaning, a player chooses what type of mage they want to play typically by taking particular spell set. For example, a mage aligning themselves with the light element could take spells focusing on healing as well as sealing and exorcising undead.
